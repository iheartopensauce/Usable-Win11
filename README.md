# Usable-Win11

This project is meant to make maximizing the privacy and security of Windows 11 as easy as possible. This guide assumes you are able to download and flash Windows 11 23h2 on an installation medium.
This guide also assumes you are using the enterprise or education edition, as it unlocks 'Telemetry level 0'

- Go through install, and select education edition (skip this if you downloaded the enterprise iso)
- After it finishes installing and it reboots, press the 'shift' key and the 'f10' key at the same time. Once the command prompt pulls up, type in: oobe\BypassNRO
- Then, press enter.
- After the reboot, select france as your region. This will allow us to FINALLY UNINSTALL EDGE, along with some other cool features. Selecting 'France' will not impact your UX.
- Click through the settings until you can press 'I don't have internet', and 'Continue with limited setup'
- Pick a name to distinguish this as the admin account
- Skip entering a password for now, so we won't have to use security questions.\
- Select 'No' and 'Required Only' on the appropriate selections, and then wait for the setup to complete.
