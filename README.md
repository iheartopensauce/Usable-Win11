# Usable-Win11

This project is meant to make maximizing the privacy and security of Windows 11 as easy as possible. This guide assumes you are able to download and flash Windows 11 23h2 on an installation medium.
This guide also assumes you are using the enterprise or education edition, as it unlocks 'Telemetry level 0'

- Go through install, and select education edition (skip this if you downloaded the enterprise iso)
- After install, select france as your region. This will allow us to FINALLY UNINSTALL EDGE, along with some other cool features. Selecting 'France' will not impact your UX.
